# Django-BlogSite

Hello People!!

So here I am trying to build a really small and basic Blog Site with the very basic functionalities of 
  Loging in
  writing blogs/ reading blogs
  commenting
  liking 
  sharing
  displaying blogs

I am really new to django but I want to excel in it.

Here you can easily trace the files, the names are self descriptive (I'll be updating the flow in my next push)

The requirements that I find important are present in "note.txt" file.
